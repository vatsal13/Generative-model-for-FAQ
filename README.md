Forked code.
Modified the seq2seq code. Added beam search. Takes an input width w. And samples output uses beam-search of width w.

A general-purpose encoder-decoder framework for Tensorflow that can be used for Machine Translation, Text Summarization, Conversational Modeling, Image Captioning, and more.
